## Title: GeoLocating

## Description

I plan to train neural networks for the task of performing well on GeoGuessr, or more generally, successfully locating the geographical location of a given landscape image. After training, the neural network will be given an image and should output a location of said image.

I hope to potentially advance this project by furthering the identification abilities of the NN via image segmentation and further training on additional datasets of specific objects or written texts found within the image such as architecture, automobiles, signs, etc.

The fully trained NN will be implemented as a web-based application where users may upload their own images and see how the Neural Net performs. 

## Goals
1. Create a dataset for training a NN for geolocation via image scraping if one doesnâ€™t already exist.
2. Implement multiple neural networks working on different tasks for the sake of one larger goal.
3.  Get a stronger feel of comfort for the implementation of neural networks and dataset usage.
4. Train a NN that is able to successfully geolocate an image.
