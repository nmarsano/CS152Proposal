## GeoLocating

## Proposal 

I plan to train neural networks for the task of getting perfect scores on GeoGuessr, or more generally, successfully locating the geographical location of a static image. After training, the neural network will be given an image and should output a location of said image.

I hope to potentially advance this project by furthering the identification abilities of the NN via image segmentation and further training on additional datasets of specific objects or written texts.

The fully trained NN will be implemented as a web-based application where users may upload their own images. 

## Goals:
1. Create a dataset for training a NN for geolocation via image scraping if one doesnâ€™t already exist.
2. Implement multiple neural networks working on different tasks for the sake of one larger goal.
3.  Get a stronger feel of comfort for the implementation of neural networks and dataset usage.
4. Train a NN that is able to successfully geolocate an image.
